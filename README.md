## BOT
Bot is a software program that can execute commands, reply to messages, or perform routine tasks, as online searches, either automatically or with minimal human intervention (often used in combination):

* a social media _bot_ retweeting certain posts.
* a customer service _chatbot_ to answer product questions.
